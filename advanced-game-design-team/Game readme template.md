# Repo Name

[Provide basic instructions to build and run. Try to make them platform agnostic, and link to relevant documentation. If applicable, make note of any additional dependencies not covered by a normal SplashKit installation.]

1. Requires a [SplashKit installation](https://splashkit.io/installation/).
2. Build using `skm clang++ *.cpp -o game-name` while in the project folder.
3. Run using `./game-name` while in the project folder.

_See also: usage documentation for [skm](https://github.com/splashkit/skm/blob/master/README.MD) and [SplashKit](https://splashkit.io/guides/using-splashkit/0-overview/)._

## Technical overview

- **Language:** C++ / C#
- **Current scope:** Small / Medium / Large _[How much stuff does the project currently do? Is there lots of code covering many different game systems? Quantity of project files and their average length is a good guideline.]_
- **Code quality:** Poor / Fair / Good / Excellent _[Poor = does not meet minimum quality standards (should be rare!). Excellent = Not necessarily perfect, but very good - good enough that the program's implementations can be used as reference.]_
- **Gameplay implementation:** Incomplete / Complete _[Complete games may still have room for further expansion by adding new levels / mechanics etc, but have a complete start-to-finish gameplay loop implemented.]_

## Gameplay overview

[Note the number of supported players and describe the game's genre and core gameplay loop. Try to be reasonably succinct - not _every_ mechanic has to be in this summary.]

[Include game controls in a format like below. If the game supports more than 1 player, list the controls for each player.]

### Player 1 Controls

| Action        | Key          |
|---------------|--------------|
| Move Forward  | Up arrow     |
| Rotate Left   | Left arrow   |
| Rotate Right  | Right arrow  |
| Fire          | Left CTRL    |

## Other notes

[Add concise, valuable information such as links to supporting programs like level editors, or additional documentation. Don't add verbose information here - save new documentation in `/docs/` and link to it if you have detailed information you want to pass on. Leave as "N/A" or remove section if there's nothing to add.]

## Screenshots

[Provide 1-3 screenshots of the game. These screenshots should capture the game's core gameplay - avoid adding screenshots of menu screens etc.]

## Credits

[Make best effort to include the original author or original team of authors, plus anyone who made a massive contribution (like a full refactor) later on. Not all authors need to be explicitly credited here, as git will track that for us. Can remove section if credit is difficult to figure out even after snooping git histories.]

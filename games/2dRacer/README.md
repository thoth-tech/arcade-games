## Other

- There are two sub-projects within this project: "basic" and "advanced". The advanced version supercedes the basic version, and is what is described in this readme.
- Additional documentation from the original author is available in [2D_Racer.rmd](docs/2D_Racer.rmd) and [2D_Racer.docx](docs/2D_Racer.docx). They were written as if the game were complete, so could be considered more of a to-do list rather than a description of the current implementation.
